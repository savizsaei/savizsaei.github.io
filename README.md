# Academic Classic — one-page site

This is a professional, easy-to-navigate personal website for **Saviz Saei**.
It matches a classic academic layout: sticky top nav, hero banner with circular portrait,
and clear sections: Home, Research, Teaching, Publications, CV, Awards.

## How to use
- Replace **assets/img/profile.png** with your own photo (e.g., `profile.jpg`) and update the `<img>` `src` in `index.html`.
- Replace **assets/img/banner.png** with your own banner image if you like.
- Put your PDF at **assets/cv/Saviz-Saei-CV.pdf** to activate the **Download PDF CV** button.
- Update publications: `data/publications.json`. The page also includes an inline fallback so it works locally without a server.
